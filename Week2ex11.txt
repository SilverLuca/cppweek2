The else will correspond to the closest if statement.
    Therefore value = 5 when it passes both tests,
    value = 6 when it passes the first, but not the second
    and value is unset if it doesnt pass the first one 
    (the second test would not matter for this case)

if (first == test1) 
    if (second == test2) 
	value = 5; 
    else 
	value = 6;

we can add {} to get another interpretation:

if (first == test1)
    if (second == test2) 
    {
	value = 5; 
    }
else 
    value = 6;

The else will now correspond to the first if statement.
    We get value = 5 if it passes both tests
    And we get 6 otherwise.

The flaw is that value will be unset if it doesnt pass the first test. 
    This can be fixed by adding value = 7 (or any other number)
    before or after
